Technology advancement, adoption, and transfer refers to “level and capacity of [the fishery] to develop and acquire new technologies and methods as well as the ease with which these technologies and methods are transferred between and among actors in the system” (Mason et al. 2022). Technology transfer can help ensure the impacts of climate change do not exacerbate distributional inequities within a fishery. ","Technology can help to buffer against environmental changes (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005) and improve the adaptive capacity of fisheries management, the economic outputs from the fishery, and the well-being of stakeholders in the system. New technology could alter flows and distributions of benefits and may lead to less equitable outcomes."
